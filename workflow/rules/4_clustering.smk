"""
Cluster detection and splitting rules for the 16S consensus pipeline.

This module handles the detection of multiple strains/variants within samples
and preparation for multi-consensus generation:
1. Detect subclusters in alignment (if multiple variants exist)
2. Split reads by cluster assignment into separate FASTQ files (checkpoint)
3. Realign each cluster separately for improved accuracy

Pipeline position: FOURTH stage (parallel to naive_consensus.smk)
Upstream: align.smk (rule align)
Downstream: multi_consensus.smk (rule cluster_consensus)
