"""
Naive consensus generation rules for the 16S consensus pipeline.

This module handles the "naive" consensus path - generating a single consensus
sequence per sample without attempting to detect and separate multiple strains:
1. Generate consensus using winner-takes-all approach from alignment
2. Pool all naive consensuses into a single database FASTA

Pipeline position: THIRD stage (parallel to clustering.smk)
Upstream: align.smk (rule align)
Downstream: summary.smk (rule generate_summary)

    Positions below threshold are marked with winner base and variants recorded.
    This assumes a single strain per sample and takes the most common base at
    each position (no cluster separation).
